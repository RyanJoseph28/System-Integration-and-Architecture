# System-Integration-and-Architecture

I expect that in this subject System Integration and Architecture that I will learn a lot of new things that will help me better understand how different systems actually work together. I know there will be challenges and times that it will give us a hard time but I still hope that our journey will be fun and enjoyable. I want this subject to expand my knowledge and give me a deeper appreciation and understanding for technology.

I also look forward to discovering concepts and ideas that I haven’t encountered before. I don’t just want to learn the basics but I also want to really understand how they connect to real situations and how I can use them in the future. I hope the lessons will be explained clearly and in a way that it will make the subject easier so I won’t feel too stressed. I want this subject to help me grow at my own pace while still being motivated to keep learning.

I’m excited about exploring new knowledge, sharing ideas with my classmates, and learning from our professor. I want to enjoy the whole process even during the challenging parts. I also expect that this subject will inspire me to see the bigger picture of my course and my career that will remind me why I chose this path in the first place.
